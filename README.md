 Debugging Picture puzzle
 First we we completed the start file in class to create a puzzle bulding program.
 The start file allowed us to drag and drop images(puzzle pieces) into their places on a blurred out background image.
 The code allowed us to drag and drop the pieces into a drop zone.
 If two images are dropped in the same drop zone, the latest puzzle piece will be present and the previous piece will be removed.
 If the bacground image is changed, the puzzle pieces that have been dropped in the drop zone will remain.

 The code has been updated to ensure that when a puzzle piece is dropped into a drop zone with an existing puzzle piece occupying the space, it will not allow you to drop the second image in.
The second code update ensures that when the background(gameboard) is change, the puzzle pieces will immediately be sent back to their original position(start position)
